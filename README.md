### Case Study Content 

    * What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?
Robinhood is a financial services company. The company offers a mobile app and website that offer people the ability to invest in stocks, ETFs, and options through Robinhood Financial and crypto trading through Robinhood Crypto. They do this as a 100% online company (ie. no storefront locations)
Their competitors are Webull, TD Ameritrade, First Trade, & M1 Finance.

    * How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?
Their use of the internet allows them to keep facilities & staff costs at a minimum because they handle their customers online. This allows Robinhood to have less cost & fees for their clients.
Robinhood uses the statistical automation and signal sampling to output predictive models that help their firm to maximize the investments of their clients. They also use the technology to educate their clients on the financial industry.


    * Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?


Robinhood is exemplary in the FinTech space because they are enabling a population of people who wouldn’t typically be trading to make trades from their phone. The focus on their easy to use mobile app platform is RobinHood's greatest strength but it also presents several weaknesses.

Robinhood is the perfect app for a beginning trader because the app is intuitive and has great tutorials and easy to follow instructions. The mobile app focuses on letting traders know exactly how much money they have made or loss, allowing traders to make trading decisions while on the go and sends the user real time information (depending on your subscription level). Another major strength of the app is the fact that do not charge any commission fees but many of their competitors are not charging commissions.

One of the major weaknesses of the platform is that it executes trades much slower than on many other platforms such as Webull and Think or Swim. Another major weakness is the amount of data Robinhood provides to the user. You cannot manipulate charts nor 

    * What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?

While Robin Hoods user base is growing rapidly my personal prognosis for the company is bleak. As show below Robinhood was fined for not executing orders so that its customers received the best prices. Also Robinhood seems to be a tool that focuses on exploiting beginners as well. As millennials and its current users mature they should learn that there are several other platforms such as Webull that offer 0 commissions, mobile apps and execute orders much faster!

The company is planning on going public in the near future and is currently worth $11 Billion. The majority of their profits come from marginal lending and subscription that most of the users don't pay for. The future of this company depends on if they can stay ahead of their competition and continue to grow its user base.
